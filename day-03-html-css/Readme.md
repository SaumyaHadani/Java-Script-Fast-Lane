## Overview

When you think of HTML and CSS, you probably imagine them as a package deal.The original plan for the web offered no way to style a website at all.Because there was no way to style a website with HTML, the only thing web developers could tell when asked about visual design was, “sorry you're screwed.”

HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!HTML was created to describe the content of a web page.When tags like `<font>`, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

10 years later, CSS was on its way to full adoption by a newly enthused web community.CSS stood out because it was simple, especially compared to some of its earliest competitors.CSS is a declarative programming language. When we write CSS, we don't tell the browser exactly how to render a page. Instead, we describe the rules for our HTML document one by one and let browsers handle the rendering.
